# SQL Project: Global Life Institute Data Detectives
<!-- endhide -->

> Have you finished the SQL Bolt interactive exercises? We strongly recommend doing them before moving forward with this project.

This is what you will learn during this project:

- Use a preloaded database with pre-existing data.
- Execute SQL statements to explore and analyze data in a biodiversity and climate change scenario.
- Practice inserting, updating, and deleting relevant data as part of a data quality maintenance simulation.
- Use SQL Alchemy, the industry's most popular library for connecting to SQL databases.
- Use Pandas to display the results of your queries as DataFrames.

Within this repository, you will find a file named `./INSTRUCTIONS.md` with the necessary steps to complete it.

## üå± How to start this project

This project comes with the necessary files to start working immediately.

We recommend opening this very same repository using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command. 

This is the repository you need to fork and open:

```text
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/exploratory-sql-analysis-project
```

**üëâ Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

Once your project and code have finished opening, you can go ahead and open the `./src/sql/queries.sql` file and start solving each exercise inside the notebook.

## üöÄ Make Your Work Visible

One of the main goals of this project is to showcase real and applied skills on your professional profile. You worked with real open data from the [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) portal, executed SQL queries, analyzed biodiversity, and visualized valuable patterns.

Publish an insight on LinkedIn that demonstrates analytical thinking based on real data.

### What to Share?
Based on your analysis, write one or two sentences summarizing what you discovered. The goal is to communicate your findings objectively, briefly, and backed by data. Add a chart if you like, and use hashtags to amplify your reach.

### ‚ú® Postable Examples

> **"The top 5 most observed species in my region [Buenos Aires] account for 27% of the total records in that area. Their dominant presence might indicate unique adaptive habits. üê¶üìç #Biodiversity #DataScience"**

> **"New South Wales (Australia) leads in diversity with over 120 distinct species recorded. Real GBIF data reveals unexpected biodiversity hotspots! üåøüåè #SQL #OpenData"**


## üöõ How to deliver this project

Once you have finished solving the exercises, be sure to commit your changes, push them to your repository, and go to 4Geeks.com to upload the repository link.

## Solutions

We also incorporated the solution samples in `./src/solution.py` that we strongly suggest you only use if you are stuck for more than 30 minutes or if you have already finished and want to compare it with your approach.
